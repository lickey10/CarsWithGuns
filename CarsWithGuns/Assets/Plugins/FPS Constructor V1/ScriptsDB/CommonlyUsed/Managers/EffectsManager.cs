This script is the manager script for the FPS package's effects system. It has two major r. The first is creating,
storing, and managing all the effects sets which will be used in the scene. The user interacts with the script through a custom
editor script called "EffectsManagerEditor", which can be found in the Editor folder.

The script also plays a role in the actual execution of effects at runtime. When a player shoots a wall which uses a hit effect, this
script instantiates the appropriate decal effect; it is also responsible for playing hit sounds and hit effects. The only effect which
is not applied by this script are footstep sounds. Footsteps are handled in a script called "Footstep", which is attached to the player.
